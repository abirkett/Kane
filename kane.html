  <li> Kane hasn't issued a book and this makes him worried, and anxious. He also knows he must now carry a heavy book around, and do extra work which makes him sad. </li>
   <li> Kane is also now confused, he trys to figure the library coding out himself but can't. </li>
    <li> Kane sees that a librarian is at the main desk, she is approachable and his issue is understood and quickly resolved. This pleasent interaction, and fast solution makes him very happy. </li>
     <li> The librarian then takes Kane straight to the desk and issues the book out. All this help and supports means Kane hasn't spent a long time borrowing the book like he thought he would. This paired with his new understanding of the library layout and code makes him extremely happy. </li>
      <li> Kane quickly remembers all the work this book will make, and how heavy his bag is. His emotion drops right back down, but he is still a little more content as the jobs done, and he will know for next time. </li>
